# prj2-advanced-lighting
This repository contains my theoretical understanding (correct as well as incorrect and incomplete parts) about advanced lighting models used in computer graphics.

As of now, all code of prototypes and examples will be available in my fork of [SLProject](https://github.com/s-thoeni/SLProject)

## Abstract
Finding a way to do photorealistic (i.e physically correct) rendering in real time is considered the holy grail of computer graphics. The goal of this project is to research the (future) industry standard for real time rendering and obtain a theoretical understanding for the methods used. The results will be presented in the form of a documentation available here on github. 

## Administratives
This project is/will be done in the setting of the course 'Projekt 2' of the [Bern University of Applied Science](https://www.ti.bfh.ch/).

### Project planning / Time Schedule
A rough overview of how i plan on spending my time during this course. 
#### Part 1 - Research (CW 9-14 | 26.02.2018 - 02.04.2018)
    * Research, describe and explain theoretical key concepts such as the rendering equation and the bidirectional reflectance distributon function
    * Give an overview about the current methods used to 'solve' the rendering equation in real time used by state of the art computer graphics software such as modeling software or 3D engines (Unity3D, Blender, Unreal Engine)
 
#### Part 2 - Deep dive (CW 14-19 | 02.04.2018 - 07.05.2018)
    * Of a certain key method or aspect that has been described in Part 1 (e.g. Irradiance maps, spherical harmonics ):
      * Write a prototype for demonstrational purposes
      * Describe usage, justification, advantages and disadvantages
      
#### Part 3 - Distil (CW 19-24 | 07.05.2018 - 11.06.2018)
    * Boil down the documentation into a few easy digestable pages
    * Identify a specific topic worthy of further research 
    * Formulate a research objective for my bachelor thesis :-)
