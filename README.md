# prj2-advanced-lighting
This repository contains my theoretical understanding (correct as well as incorrect and incomplete parts) about advanced lighting models used in computer graphics.

As of now, all code of prototypes and examples will be available in my fork of [SLProject](https://github.com/s-thoeni/SLProject)

## Abstract
Finding a way to do photorealistic (i.e physically correct) rendering in realtime is considered the holy grail of computer graphics. The goal of this project is to research the (future) industry standard for real time rendering and obtain a theoretical understanding for the methods used. The results will be presented in the form of a documentation available here on github. 

## Administratives
This project is/will be done in the setting of the course 'Projekt 2' of the [Bern University of Applied Science](https://www.ti.bfh.ch/).
